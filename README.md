# HTTP Example in Swift

This is just an example of basic knowledge of HTTP calls in iOS. This is code is rough, but from this base I will be able to quickly self-learn HTTP / HTTPS related calls when needed.

BackendAPI is a Class I made to retrieve and post users and posts from a DynamoDB/Node.js backend running on a AWS server. The app this is for is a Social Networking iOS app to help people hang out in person with their friends in the area right now. Note: for this app, I've curently transitioned to using Parse as a backend since its much easier to iterate using Parse.
